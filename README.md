# Privacy-Funnel
Researching The Privacy funnel under Maximal Leakage problem. The PF Problem is closely connected to the information bottleneck problem, 
which has important applications in machine learning. We are actually interested in releasing information about a certain variable X,
while minimizing the information revealed about a correlated random variable S.
Used a greedy algorithm approach to deliver a piecewise linear graph depicting leakage with corresponding level of informativeness.
